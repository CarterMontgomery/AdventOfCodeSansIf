# IflessAdventOfCode
2021 Advent of Code, without any if statements. (Will have the if \_\_name\_\_ == "\_\_main\_\_" for python scripts).

A small challenege to do all 2021 advent of code elements without any if statements.
Things that emulate if statements, such as one-time for loops or while loops on a specific condition are discouraged.

Let me know if you have any questions!
